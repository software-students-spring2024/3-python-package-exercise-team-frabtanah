Replace the contents of the [README.md](./README.md) file with a beautifully-formatted Markdown file including a plain-language **description** of your project and **clear instructions**, including exact **code examples**, for:

- how a developer who wants to import your project into their own code can do so - include documentation for all functions in your package and a link to an example Python program that uses each of them.
- how a developer who wants to contribute to your project can set up the virtual environment, install dependencies, and build and test your package for themselves.

## Description

pyMood is a python package designed to give a quick mood boost to programmers. With simple commands, users can get positive affirmations, quick jokes, or even a virtual high five among other things. It's perfect for when you need a quick pick-me-up during a coding session.

## Instructions

For any developers who want to import pyMood into their own code, follow the steps below:

To install the module from PyPI, run the command:

``pip install pyMood``

## Usage

We have several functions to use from within pyMood.

```python

relaxation_tip(category)
# the parameter category allows the user to select a category from the following: music, nature, exercise, aromatherapy, writing, mindfulness or breathing. The function will then return a relaxation tip related to the selected category
# additionally, the user may elect to input no category at all and receive a random relaxation tip from any of the categories.
```
