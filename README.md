# Python Mood Enhancer (PyMood)

![example workflow](https://github.com/github/docs/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)

An exercise to create a Python package, build it, test it, distribute it, and use it. See [instructions](./instructions.md) for details.

Include a [badge](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/monitoring-and-troubleshooting-workflows/adding-a-workflow-status-badge) at the top of the `README.md` file showing the result of the latest build/test workflow run.

Replace the contents of the [README.md](./README.md) file with a beautifully-formatted Markdown file including a plain-language **description** of your project and **clear instructions**, including exact **code examples**, for:

- how a developer who wants to import your project into their own code can do so - include documentation for all functions in your package and a link to an example Python program that uses each of them.
- how a developer who wants to contribute to your project can set up the virtual environment, install dependencies, and build and test your package for themselves.

## Description
